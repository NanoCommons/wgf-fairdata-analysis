# NanoSafety cluster Work Group F FAIR maturity indicator analysis

This webpage summarizes the current outcomes of the effort by the European nanosafety community
into establishing more FAIR data sets and databases. For this, it has developed a Jupyter notebook
that applies a previously published approach to measure in initial level of FAIR-ness. This
commnunity is working on establishing additional maturity indicators specific and more relevant
to reuse of the data being analysis (and needed for risk governance.
